    "# Getting Started with DeepStream for Video Analytics on Jetson Nano\n",
    "The DeepStream SDK offers a complete set of sample reference applications and pre-trained neural networks to jump-start development. In this course, you'll leverage these samples to build your own DeepStream applications to analyze and annotate video streams.\n",
